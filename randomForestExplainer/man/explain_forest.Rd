\usage{
explain_forest(forest, interactions = FALSE, data = NULL, vars = NULL,
  no_of_pred_plots = 3, pred_grid = 100, measures = if (forest$type ==
  "classification") c("mean_min_depth", "accuracy_decrease", "gini_decrease",
  "no_of_nodes", "times_a_root") else c("mean_min_depth", "mse_increase",
  "node_purity_increase", "no_of_nodes", "times_a_root"))
}
\arguments{
\item{forest}{A randomForest object created with the option localImp = TRUE}

\item{interactions}{Logical value: should variable interactions be considered (this may be time-consuming)}

\item{data}{The data frame on which forest was trained - necessary if interactions = TRUE}

\item{vars}{A character vector with variables with respect to which interactions will be considered if NULL then they will be selected using the important_variables() function}

\item{no_of_pred_plots}{The number of most frequent interactions of numeric variables to plot predictions for}

\item{pred_grid}{The number of points on the grid of plot_predict_interaction (decrease in case memory problems)}

\item{measures}{A character vector specifying the importance measures to be used for plotting ggpairs}
